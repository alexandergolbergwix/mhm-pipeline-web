# eval-agent

A **long-running LLM evaluation agent** that judges every output of an
ML pipeline against the source record using Gemini 3.x as judge.
Designed as a reference implementation of Anthropic's
[effective harnesses for long-running agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)
pattern, applied to evaluation systems.

**What it demonstrates** (single-line summary per pillar):

- **Agent harness** — Initializer + Worker split; mandatory session-startup procedure (`git log` → `progress.md` tail → `feature_list.json` → `make verify` → only then execute); pluggable evaluator + judge interfaces; tool registry.
- **AI memory hierarchy** — four explicit layers: working (per-Worker), episodic (`state/runs/*/results.jsonl`), semantic (`state/cache/verdict_cache.jsonl`, SHA-256-keyed, append-only), procedural (`state/feature_list.json` + `state/progress.md`).
- **Context engineering** — per-evaluator MARC field projection; explicit prompt budget; structured-output schemas physically prevent malformed JSON.
- **Production LLM client** — sliding-window threading-safe rate limiter; structured-output enforcement via `responseSchema`; exponential-backoff retry; explicit thinking-token control; content-addressed verdict cache.
- **Experimentation system** — pluggable `Judge` interface (Gemini today, Claude/GPT plug-in); cross-run `diff` for regression detection; schema-versioned verdicts; mandatory self-verification (5% re-judge) on every run.
- **Real-world deployment** — evaluates 5 trained models (3 NER, 2 classifiers) on a 68-record corpus from a Hebrew-manuscript PhD pipeline; ~$0.30 per full run; zero 429s.

It started life as a one-off 838-line script in the parent pipeline
repo and was deliberately extracted into a standalone project with
proper module boundaries, schema versioning, append-only memory, and
session state.

The application here is **evaluating an ML pipeline's outputs** — but
the harness pattern (long-running, file-backed memory, tool registry,
self-verification) ports cleanly to any agent system that needs to
survive across sessions and accumulate knowledge.

## Parent context

The parent project is the **MHM Pipeline** at
`/Users/alexandergo/Documents/Doctorat/pipeline` — a digital-humanities
MARC-to-Wikidata conversion pipeline for Hebrew manuscripts (PhD
dissertation in progress). The pipeline ships 5 trained models (3 NER
based on DictaBERT + 2 multi-label classifiers) plus 4 downstream
stages (authority resolution, RDF mapping, SHACL validation, Wikidata
upload).

The eval-agent reads the pipeline's JSON outputs and judges them.
**Loose coupling, file paths only** — no Python imports from the
pipeline repo. Pipeline can ship; eval-agent stays independent.

---

## Why a separate project

The eval logic started life as a 838-line script in the pipeline repo
(`pipeline/scripts/evaluate_models_with_gemini.py`). It worked, but it
was:

- a throw-away script, not infrastructure
- coupled to the pipeline repo
- not resumable beyond the SHA-256 verdict cache
- single-judge (Gemini) hardcoded into every layer
- no upgrade path to evaluate Stages 3–6

`eval-agent` extracts that logic into a standalone, file-coupled tool
with proper module boundaries, a pluggable `Evaluator` interface, and
session memory.

**Loose coupling:** the agent **reads pipeline JSON from disk** and
never imports pipeline modules. Pipeline can ship; eval-agent stays
independent. If the pipeline schema changes, only the ingest layer
needs an update.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap (one-shot, idempotent)
cd /Users/alexandergo/Documents/Doctorat/eval-agent
bash init.sh

# 2. Doctor — confirm API key, schemas, cache, fixtures
make doctor

# 3. Run against a pipeline output folder
export GEMINI_API_KEY="…"
make run PIPELINE_OUTPUT=/Users/alexandergo/Documents/Doctorat/pipeline/eval/work

# 4. Read the latest report
ls -t state/runs/ | head -1 | xargs -I{} cat state/runs/{}/report.md
```

## What it evaluates (MVP)

All 5 trained models from MHM Pipeline Stage 2:

| Evaluator | Source field | Sub-types |
|---|---|---|
| `person_ner` | `entities[source=person_ner]` | AUTHOR, TRANSCRIBER, TRANSLATOR, COMMENTATOR, OWNER, EDITOR, CENSOR |
| `provenance_ner` | `entities[source=provenance_ner]` | OWNER, DATE, COLLECTION |
| `contents_ner` | `entities[source=contents_ner]` | WORK, FOLIO, WORK_AUTHOR |
| `genre_classifier` | `ml_genres[]` | 8 Hebrew-MS genre classes + NOTA |
| `marc500_colophon` | `ml_colophon_sentences[]` | COLOPHON (binary) |

Roadmap (post-MVP): Stage 3 authority resolution, Stage 4 RDF mapping,
Stage 5 SHACL violation triage, Stage 6 Wikidata upload diff. Adding
each is **one new evaluator module** under `eval_agent/evaluators/`.

---

## What gets produced per run

Every `make run` writes a self-contained run folder under
`state/runs/<YYYYMMDDThhmmssZ>/`:

```
state/runs/20260516T143000Z/
├── manifest.json          # pipeline input paths + agent config + session id + cache hits/misses
├── results.jsonl          # one line per judged candidate (~150–200 per run)
├── summary.csv            # per-(evaluator, sub_type) precision metrics
├── report.md              # human-readable summary + sample failures
└── self_verify.json       # 5% re-judge consistency check
```

The verdict schema lives at `config/schemas/verdict.v1.json`. Every
`results.jsonl` entry carries its `schema_version` so older runs can
be diffed against newer ones cleanly.

## Architecture

See `CLAUDE.md` for the full operating manual + design rationale.
Headlines:

- **`eval_agent/client/`** — Gemini REST client, sliding-window
  rate-limiter, abstract `Judge` interface
- **`eval_agent/cache/`** — SHA-256-keyed JSONL verdict cache (every
  re-run is incremental)
- **`eval_agent/ingest/`** — readers for pipeline JSON outputs; no
  pipeline imports
- **`eval_agent/evaluators/`** — one module per (stage, model);
  declares its MARC slice, prompt rubric, and verdict parser
- **`eval_agent/orchestration/`** — session lifecycle, feature list,
  progress log, self-verification
- **`eval_agent/report/`** — JSONL/CSV/Markdown writers + cross-run
  diff
- **`config/rubrics/`** — per-evaluator prompt templates (Markdown)
- **`config/schemas/`** — versioned JSON Schemas
- **`state/`** — feature_list.json + progress.md + per-run artefacts

## CLI

```text
eval-agent
├── init        # bootstrap (idempotent)
├── verify      # session-startup pre-flight
├── run         # judge a pipeline output end-to-end
├── report      # regenerate report.md from results.jsonl
├── diff        # compare two runs for regression detection
├── recover     # safe-mode: rebuild state from cache + git
├── orchestrate # LLM planner over eval-agent state and benchmark evidence
└── doctor      # health check
```

`make <subcommand>` proxies to the CLI for common workflows.

The orchestrator is for "what should we do next?" decisions. It asks Gemini
for one strict-JSON action at a time, validates the action in Python, runs only
allowlisted tools, and writes `state/orchestrator/sessions/<ts>/trace.jsonl`,
`decisions.jsonl`, and `final_report.md`.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m eval_agent.cli orchestrate \
  --goal "Inspect person NER metrics and recommend the next evaluation step" \
  --plan-only \
  --pipeline-root /Users/alexandergo/Documents/Doctorat/pipeline \
  --pipeline-output /Users/alexandergo/Documents/Doctorat/pipeline/eval/work
```

## Key invariants

(Always-on rules; the agent will refuse to start if any are violated.)

1. **Never write back into the pipeline repo.** This includes the
   pipeline's `data/`, `eval/`, `dist/`, etc.
2. **Never make Wikidata writes.** All Wikidata-touching evaluators
   are dry-run only — read-only judgement against pipeline output.
3. **`make verify` must pass** before any new evaluator run. Workers
   refuse to start new judgements if cache integrity is broken or
   schemas don't validate.
4. **Cache + commits are append-only.** Bad runs are recovered via
   `eval-agent recover` (replays from cache + git), not by deleting
   files.

---

## Cost & runtime budget

Default judge is **`gemini-3.5-flash`** (stable, high free-tier quota,
~10× cheaper than Pro). Switch with `--judge <id>` per run.

| Judge | Per-candidate cost | Per-run (~162 cand.) | Default RPM | Runtime |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `gemini-3.5-flash` (default) | ~$0.0002 | **~$0.03** | 60 | ~3 min |
| `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | ~$0.0019 | ~$0.30 | 25 | ~7 min |
| `gemini-2.5-pro` | ~$0.0021 | ~$0.34 | 25 | ~7 min |

Cache hits are free — incremental re-runs cost only the new
candidates. The verdict cache key includes the judge id, so
switching judges invalidates the cache cleanly.

## Status

- **Phase 0 (Bootstrap):** complete — directory layout, init.sh,
  pyproject, Makefile, README, CLAUDE.md
- **Phase 1 (MVP):** in progress — porting evaluators from the
  pipeline script
- **Phase 2 (Harness hardening):** pending — feature_list,
  progress.md, self_verify, verify, recover

See `state/progress.md` for the current session log.
