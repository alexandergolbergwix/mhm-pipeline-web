"""Pluggable Evaluator interface.

An Evaluator declares:

  - ``id``                — canonical name (matches feature_list.json)
  - ``sub_types``          — categories broken out in metrics
  - ``marc_field_keys``    — semantic MARC slice this evaluator needs
  - ``confidence_field``   — which entity key drives the threshold filter
  - ``rubric_name``        — name of the per-evaluator rubric markdown

And implements:

  - ``extract_candidates(record, marc, threshold)`` → list[Candidate]
  - ``build_prompt(candidate)``                     → str
  - ``parse_verdict(raw, candidate)``               → Verdict

Adding a new evaluator (e.g. for Stage 3 authority resolution) is one
new module under ``eval_agent/evaluators/`` + a rubric file + a
registry entry. No harness changes needed.
